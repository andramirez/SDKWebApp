#### Theme: 
The theme of my Web App is Writers' quotes. As the twitter api generates quotes from five authors: JK Rowling, Dr. Seuss, William Shakespear, Aldous Huxley, and Stephen King, Getty images produces images that are related to each indivdual author whether it be pictures of the authors themseleves, or pictures related to their writing. 

#### Acknowledgement of Problems:
Some problems that I have come to realize about my Web app is the strength of the relations of the images to the quotes themselves. With the query of the getty images app only being the name of the author, I have come to realize that getty images will not always produce a prevelant image to fit the quote I have requested. Another issue I have found is that since I am taking tweets from specific users, some of the tweets won't always be quotes from the authors themseleves. Some of the tweets will only include the name of the author but won't contain an actual quote from the author. 

#### Improvement: 
I feel that I could improve my Web App by including a better search query for both the images and the quotes to be more specific to what I want them to display. Also, I feel as though I can create a more cohesive theme like authors of a certain genre or authors of a specific time period.
